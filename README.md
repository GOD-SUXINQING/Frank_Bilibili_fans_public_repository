This repository contains some useful materials for your learning.

Because the upper limit of the github repository is 1GB, in order to store more information, for non-code files, we recommend uploading to your own network disk, copying the sharing link, creating an md file, pasting the sharing link into the created md file, and uploading md file.We recommend that you use simple and easy-to-understand file names for readers to understand at a glance.
For example:If Frank has something to update,he put his files on BaiduPan ,then he submit a md file.In the file is "分享链接：http://baiud...........\n   提取码:...."The md file's name might be "Frank's Java videos.md"

Suppose you want to upload a book, for example, the name of the book is C Primer Plus. But you find that there is already a C_Primer_Plus.md file. We suggest you copy your link, enter this file, and paste a blank line below the original text to diversify sources of resources and reduce data loss due to accidental reasons.

We welcome you to upload files to establish a relatively complete information viewing system, so that you can quickly retrieve the data and get the information you want when you need relevant information.

If you do not have the upload authority, please contact the relevant personnel in the QQ group 1039508766 to indirectly upload data or obtain the upload authority.
If the contributor feels that this readme file needs to be supplemented, please add it before the final thank you. This document is not a complete version. You are welcome to add it.
